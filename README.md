* Tic-Tac-Toe:
    Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Here I use Minimax algorithm to make the AI player unbeatable. In this project anyone can play with AI as well as with a person.

* ChatBot Python
     This is a simple chatbot with rule based responses. Here I use if-else pattern to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.

* Movie Recommder System
    Here I try to create a simple recommendation system for movies that suggests items to users based on their preferences. I use content-based filtering to recommend movies.
